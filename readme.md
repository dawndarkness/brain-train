# Brain-Train

Train your brain with simple mental maths.
This game is still under development, and was developed during my time as a student at Code Chrysalis.

## About Brain-Train

Brain-Train aims to help young and old alike build their mental arithmetic skills. On game launch the player can select whether they want to practice addition, subtraction, multiplication or division by clicking the appropriate icon. The game then randomly generates different numbers/ equations for the player to solve. 

It is important to note that whatever the player types will count as input into the game. After completing their answer, they can press submit and then next question to generate another question. Once they have finished with their training, they can select the quit button on the top right of the game screen.
